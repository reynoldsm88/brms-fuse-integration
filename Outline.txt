1) Core models and common code should be in separate repositories and should be maintained separately from applications
2) Camel bundles should perform only a few specific functions very well, but should be limited in scope (ie: small number of routes)
3) Complex integrations should be built by composing smaller applications together, reusing existing integration flows and interfaces if possible
4) Business rules should have a push based deployment (ie: a user must take an action to push new rules out, rules should not be pulled)
5) Rules for a given domain should be shared via a shared service for that business domain
6) The development of applications for repetive or similar scenarios should be automated using Maven archetypes and configuration

Discrete Composable applications vs. Microservices

Project structure

models - Schemas, JAXB objects, domain models
    \_ test-app-model

common - libraries reused across many applications
    \_ test-app-brms service

applications - camel integration flows
    \_ test-application-in - REST, SOAP JMS, TCP, etc... use Camel components to transform into domain model
     _ test application-xlate - actual processing, enrichment, business rules, etc...
     _ test-application-out - JDBC, JMS, REST, SOAP to downstream systems.

rules (this is not part of any project, it should be hosted in BRMS Business Central)
    \_ test-application-rules - business rules, BPM processes, decision tables


Next steps
    - get rid of JMX based push service, possibly move retrieving knowledge sessions from JDG
    - Implement better BRMS/Drools OSGI integration (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DROOLS-969) OR roll a custom BRMS Drools camel component
    - Implement kickstarter Maven archetypes
    
Issues:
https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/01602693 - BRMS artifact resolution plugging into Fabric infrastructure
https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/01553753 - Fabric starts bundles in alphabetical order, causing application bundles to load before the BRMS infrastructure loads.
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DROOLS-969 add better support for the kie namespace in Blueprint
